This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Java related to the `continue` statement within a `while` loop.  The code appears straightforward, but the behavior might be unexpected to some. The solution provides a clear explanation and an alternative implementation that avoids the issue.  This is a good example to highlight the importance of understanding loop control flow in detail.
